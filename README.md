**A set of functions to help you work with mssql server**
<br />
<br />
**Q**: why in the description of the extension there are the words "set of functions", but there is only one function?<br />
**A**: this extension is based on my tokenizer https://github.com/VasilevVitalii/mssqlrefine, which I plan to develop further. In parallel adding new features to this extension.
